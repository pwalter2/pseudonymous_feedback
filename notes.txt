Goals:
   No sock puppets. User account is unique and pseudonymous.
   1 user account per employee.

   Could be an interesting web service to offer to companies.


Defend against:
    non-consensual identification of feedback user
    prevent employee X from posing / posting as employee Y
    

Things that are close but imperfect:
   1. Google forms with "no collect email" and "limited to 1 response"
    deleting a response allows responder to submit a new one.
   Missing features:
      boss cannot respond to a given response.
      still vulnerable to sock puppet attack if responses are deleted (allowing user to submit more)


Things that will not work:
   1. Allocate a fixed number of hashed identifiers. 
   Boss distributes hashed identifier to new employees. 
   Because Boss knows state of identifier list, employees not pseudo.

   2. Employee picks or otherwise generates their own user identifier. 
   Then, they can generate a new identifier for sock puppet attack.

   3. Feedback box that is not monitored. Submissions are then anonymous and 
    employees can sock puppet.

   4. do whatever blockchain does for identity. Will not work because blockchain 
   identity not unique. Sock puppet attack.

   


Ideas:
    need a 3rd party?
    how does blockchain do identity?
    blockchain not relevant 
    zero knowledge proof
       employee must prove that has zero or one pseudo identities. 
      preferably without revealing their own identity, but that may not be possible.

    trusted third party is Google and google forms and google account
    need to have a trusted third party because fundamentally employee must reveal
